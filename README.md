# Introduction:

EGTR stands for Easy Gui To Restore. I couldn't think of a name so I just went with that acroynm. The tool allows you to specify multiple options and get to restoring a lot easier. **I'm not responsible for any issues this may cause with your device. It works the same as futurerestore so you have the same concequences when using it.** This doesn't include any code from futurerestore or any other program. The program obtains the futurerestore binary from the official s0uthwest release repository [here](https://github.com/s0uthwest/futurerestore/releases).
